Docker images now available!

To install, first run   

    ./setup.sh
  
which will download git, clone repository and make needed adjustments. 
If you can't use this shell script, do it manually, 
you can always contact us in our support groups.

Soon docker images via docker hub will be able to be downloaded too!
